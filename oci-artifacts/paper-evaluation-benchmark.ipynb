    "Before getting started, ensure the following tools are installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ORAS CLI](https://oras.land/)\n",
    "- `tar`, `tree`, and `jq` (available on most Unix-like systems)\n",
    "- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (if you plan to run a local OCI registry)\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the ubiquity and usability of OCI registries in real-world scenarios, we evaluated the following five registries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Docker Hub: `docker.io/versioneer` see https://hub.docker.com/repositories/versioneer?search=pastis\n",
    "- Quay.io: `quay.io/versioneer-inc` see https://quay.io/repository/versioneer-inc/pastis-2433?tab=tags resp. https://quay.io/repository/versioneer-inc/pastis-t4?tab=tags\n",
    "- Harbor (hosted by OVHCloud): `qr2wz4td.c1.de1.container-registry.ovh.net/versioneer` private\n",
    "- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR): `767397985165.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/versioneer`  private\n",
    "- Zot Registry (local): `localhost:5000` using the open-source OCI compliant [Zot Registry](https://github.com/project-zot) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The repositories on Docker Hub and Quay are publicly accessible in read-only mode, so you can directly inspect the used evaluation artifacts. Harbor and AWS ECR are private instances, so you will need your own cloud subscription and authentication credentials if you want to use them. The Zot Registry is the most straightforward option to follow up. You can run it locally via:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -p 5000:5000 ghcr.io/project-zot/zot-minimal-linux-amd64:v2.1.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also experiment by running other OCI-compliant registries locally, such as [Harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor) or [Quay](https://github.com/quay/quay).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The OCI registry reference implementation provided by the [distribution](https://github.com/distribution/distribution) project supports OCI Artifacts 1.0, but does not implement the OCI 1.1 *referrers* API. As a result, features such as external signatures or linked metadata are not discoverable using the standard referrers mechanism when using this registry.\n",

    "## Reference Dataset and Partitioning Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the _Panoptic Agricultural Satellite Time Series_ ([PASTIS](https://github.com/VSainteuf/pastis-benchmark)) dataset as our reference, as it integrates diverse Earth Observation (EO) modalities, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optical time-series data from Sentinel-2  \n",
    "- Radar time-series data from Sentinel-1  \n",
    "- Very High Resolution (VHR) imagery from SPOT satellites  \n",
    "- Curated annotations, including label masks and semantic classifications  \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than preserving the original organization—which grouped data by source and required consumers to search and filter for relevant information—we restructured the dataset into an analysis-ready format using two distinct partitioning schemes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- PASTIS-2433: The entire PASTIS dataset is split into 2,433 individual per-patch subsets. Each patch is packaged into a separate TAR archive and added as a layer within a single OCI artifact. The final artifact includes 2,433 layers, each approximately 30–35 MB as well as a [config](data/config-2433.json) object that describes the metadata for each patch. This layout enables fine-grained access and maximizes deduplication across patches.\n",
    "\n",
    "- PASTIS-t4: The dataset is instead divided into four larger spatial tiles. Each tile represents a distinct region and is packaged into a TAR archive, then added as a layer in the OCI artifact. This results in 4 layers, each approximately 15–20 GB and a [config](data/config-t4.json) object that captures tile-level metadata. This approach enables high-throughput data access optimized for regional analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our own convenience, the TAR archives (both the 2,433 patches and the 4 tiles) were uploaded to an object storage bucket on OVHCloud. These were used as the source to package the evaluation OCI artifacts before pushing them to various registries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The used partitioning scripts are available [here (2433 patches)](initial-partitioning-2433) and [here (4 tiles)](initial-partitioning-t4).\n",
    "\n",
    "The scripts used to generate the config files—required for building the OCI artifacts and pushing them to a registry—are available [here (2433 patches)](generate-config-2433) and [here (4 tiles)](generate-config-2433).\n",
    "\n",
    "The original spatial metadata for the PASTIS dataset is provided as a [GeoJSON file](data/metadata_pastis.geojson) in the `data/` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: We’ve created a small sample of PASTIS-2433 with just 3 layers and a matching [config file](sample/config.json). It’s located in the `sample/` folder to help you quickly explore the data and get started."

    "## Attaching Attestations to EO Data Artifacts Using OCI Referrers\n",
    "\n",
    "OCI referrers make it possible to link auxiliary artifacts—such as signatures, validation reports, or provenance metadata—to a primary artifact by its digest, without modifying the original content. This supports traceability, trust, and structured discovery in EO data pipelines while preserving immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanism works by attaching a new artifact using its digest reference, leveraging the `oras attach` command introduced in OCI Artifacts 1.1. This allows registries that support the referrers API to expose associated artifacts in a standard way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Python script demonstrates how to attach such a referrer (e.g., a signature) to an EO data artifact and subsequently discover and inspect referrers using the ORAS CLI. This approach was also used to evaluate support for referrers across different OCI-compliant registries."

    "## Remarks and Discussion on the Benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "- All benchmarks were conducted on OCHCloud compute instances located in the Frankfurt (DE1) region.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We used the [Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) (`ab`) to explore different upload and download scenarios. These tests were exploratory rather than systematic, primarily due to cost constraints. Managed services like Docker Hub and Quay.io were only evaluated under their free-tier plans, which impose rate limits and size restrictions. For private registries, we remained within the lowest pricing tier. To avoid local caching side effects, we sandboxed some test runs in Docker containers using the `ab` tool, for example:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  docker run --rm -it \\\n",
    "    -v \"$(pwd)/output:/workspace\" \\\n",
    "    -w /workspace \\\n",
    "    ghcr.io/oras-project/oras:v1.2.2 \\\n",
    "    pull --allow-path-traversal docker.io/versioneer/pastis-2433:sample\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- We intentionally did not test extreme scenarios, such as multi-100 GB artifacts, very large individual layers, or artifacts with thousands of layers. These cases were outside the scope of our study, which focused on evaluating data packaging workflows using plausible and representative package sizes. This choice is discussed further in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deduplication was tested by uploading a small sample package first, followed by a full package. In all cases, the three shared layers from the sample were correctly reported as already existing and were not re-uploaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Upload and download resumability was also evaluated. We found that only fully completed layers were eligible for resumption. Partially transferred layers were treated as failed and had to be restarted from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sample package includes both custom annotations and non-standard media types. We confirmed that these were retained by the tested OCI-compliant registries."
