# Mission

We explore how innovation can be meaningfully applied. Rather than focusing on inventing new technologies, our research is about creatively adapting existing ones—bringing them into new domains, new contexts, and new communities where they can create real value.

Our strength lies in combining this creative mindset with deep expertise in large-scale data management and modern data engineering. We aim to make innovation usable, scalable, and aligned with the needs of real-world systems.

# Vision

We believe the future doesn’t just depend on new inventions—it depends on our ability to reuse, adapt, and extend what already works. By following open standards, embracing community practices, and applying strong engineering foundations, we help create solutions that last and scale.

## How We Work

- We identify real-world challenges where existing technology has untapped potential.

- We rely on open standards and widely adopted tools to ensure compatibility and reusability.

- We creatively adapt proven practices to new domains, extending their impact.

- We move fast and learn continuously—testing ideas through practical prototypes.

- We bring deep knowledge in data engineering to everything we do, ensuring our solutions are robust, efficient, and built for scale.
